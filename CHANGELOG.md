## [0.2.2] - 2025-10-16

### üéØ Simplified Configuration

- **Hardcoded Settings**: Pre-configured OSS bucket (`aiagenttest`), region (`oss-cn-beijing`), endpoint, and Qwen model settings
- **Simplified Setup**: Users now only need to provide 3 environment variables (API keys):
  - `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` or `QWEN_API_KEY`
  - `OSS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  - `OSS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET`
- **Removed Configuration**: No longer need to configure bucket name, region, endpoint, or model name

### üìù Documentation

- **Updated README**: Simplified configuration instructions in both English and Chinese
- **Clear Requirements**: Clearly marked which settings are pre-configured vs. which need user input

### üîß Code Changes

- **`src/utils/qwen-api.ts`**: Hardcoded model name, API endpoint, and API URL
- **`src/utils/oss-uploader.ts`**: Hardcoded bucket name, region, and endpoint
- **Security**: API keys still must be provided via environment variables (no default values)

---

## [0.2.1] - 2025-10-16

### üìù Documentation

- **Clarified Configuration Requirements**: Updated both English and Chinese README files to clearly state that both AI (Qwen) and OSS configurations are **required** for all features
- **Removed Local-Only Mode**: Removed references to "local storage only" mode to prevent confusion - all mind maps are stored in OSS
- **Enhanced Security**: Added comprehensive security documentation and improved `.gitignore` to prevent credential leaks
- **Updated Tool Requirements**: Clearly marked which tools require which configurations (AI + OSS for `text-to-mindmap`, OSS only for `markdown-to-mindmap`)

### üîí Security

- **Removed Hardcoded Credentials**: Deleted test files containing real API keys and secrets
- **Added Security Guide**: Created `SECURITY.md` with best practices for credential management
- **Enhanced .gitignore**: Added comprehensive patterns to prevent accidental credential commits
- **Added Example Files**: Created `.env.example`, `test-qwen-api.example.js`, and `claude_desktop_config.example.json` with placeholder values

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fixed misleading documentation that suggested local-only mode was available
- Removed confusing `open` parameter that was only relevant for local mode
